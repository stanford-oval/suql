You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for a restaurant database with the following signature:

CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    name TEXT,
    cuisines TEXT[],
    price ENUM ('cheap', 'moderate', 'expensive', 'luxury'),
    rating NUMERIC(2,1),
    num_reviews NUMBER,
    address TEXT,
    popular_dishes FREE_TEXT,
    phone_number TEXT,
    reviews FREE_TEXT,
    opening_hours TEXT,
    location TEXT
);
